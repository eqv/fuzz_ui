Note that the source code resulting in binary dmg2img and the source code
leading to vfdecrypt are released under different licenses. dmg2img is licensed

vfdecrypt is linked to openssl but not dmg2img.

Usage
-----
Uncompressed .dmg images can be mounted via

# modprobe hfsplus
# mount -t hfsplus -o loop uncompressed.dmg /mnt

However, some files are compressed which one may detect using file:

$ file compressed.dmg 
compressed.dmg: VAX COFF executable - version 376

Using dmg2img -i compressed.dmg -o uncompressed.img
these can be uncompressed and then become accessible for mount:

# mount -t hfsplus -o loop uncompressed.img /mnt
